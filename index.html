            <p>"Hi, I'm an elephant! I'm glad to meet you. Let's play together so that life isn't empty. Your life will be in vain if you don't have fun." Actually, elephants are the strongest. But elephants are not recognized as the strongest, nor do elephants want to admit it. In contrast to the lion who walks as if he is king and is very feared. Likewise, tigers walk without caring who the king is. Even though the tiger is not the king, it doesn't care who the king is. different from Wolves. Although he was no stronger than lions and tigers, he was never a showpiece for the circus. "But me? I always want to entertain you and play with you."</p>

            <h2>Unique Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unique Reward System:</strong> A distinctive reward system where 100% of the reward allocation is divided into two parts: 50% is allocated to the top 2000 holders, and 50% is distributed randomly to holders with at least 10 billion tokens, in varying amounts. Rewards are distributed every 2 weeks to 1 month, depending on the accumulated reward. This introduces an exciting element of surprise within the ecosystem and motivates active participation.</li>
                <li><strong>Staking and Dividends:</strong> Token holders can stake their tokens to earn additional dividends, providing an opportunity for passive income through active participation in the Elephant ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Burn Mechanism:</strong> With a 0.5% allocation for burning, Elephant periodically reduces the total supply of tokens to support scarcity and long-term value.</li>
